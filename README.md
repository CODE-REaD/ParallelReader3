# biReader
JavaScript code to read two files in parallel.  Proof-of-concept.
You may provide texts of the same article in different languages by pasting them
        to the two panels, or drag-and-drop local files to the panels, or click on the "load"
        buttons to select files from your local disc. Or click on "Load File from Online Library" to
        choose an existing pairing from the online library.

Language Bridge will attempt to present the two texts
        as equal height, synchronously scrolling panels, and to pronounce sentences
        in their native language
        when you click on them or a series of sentences when you click-and-drag over them.
        It will also attempt to pronounce and then show a definition of a word if you long-click on it (PoC:
        French to English only).

        PLEASE NOTE: this program is currently Proof Of Concept ONLY; it easily fails on invalid file
        input as no input validity checks are yet in place.
